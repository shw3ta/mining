Bangkok,Evergreen Place Siam by UHG,8.4,"Small room with a small balcony, 18th floor, not completely quiet but less noisy than street level.
Breakfast with options, didnt use the swimming pool but seemed nice and it's a big one, not a bathtub.
Friendly staff. Decent bathroom, AC is fine not super efficient but enough for human (i dont think polar bear would agree, but i don't know nor travel with any so ...). - Crappy wifi, impossible to get a signal inside the room, i had to receive my message in front of the elevator, come back to my room and go back to send them... They fixed it twice, it was so well fixed that my laptop didn't ever got connected ... I had all my call from the hotel lobby.
- As it is cheap and conveniently centrally located, a lot of bangkok teenagers use the room as mini party room... So expect some noise, music, karaoke ... on weekends, i know i did :/ ! But Thai people are generally nice and understandable, so a few knocks on the door and they'll feel so sorry, they will either offer you a drink or keep it quieter.

I had paid for a selection of flowers to be in the room on arrival for my partner and they were arranged beautifully. Excellent all round at this hotel.. This hotel is basically perfect, but if I had to choose one thing to improve, it would be the portion sizes at breakfast.

The breakfasts used to be my favourite thing about lebua, but it now has to be the fitness staff!
Beautifully warm and polite staff all round; from the managers, to the lift attendants, to the maids.

They insist to buy at leat one glass. We did it. But then they gave as a bill- it was 170 dollars for a glass!! After this they said that now they can accompany us to top floor for a view. It was such a shame- not because of a price, but more because of pressure we felt! Breakfast time- no vegetables at all. Swimming pool too small for such hotel! Horrible wifi.

The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was good.. Checking in took quite some time and we had to pay 5000 baht deposit. They said we'll receive it back to the card in 2-3 weeks, well we don't like it when someone uses our money for free. We paid this in cash... They incorrectly put Mr in front of my name and kept talking to my husband even though I clearly said that I was arranging the reservation and it is not Mr as I am a woman. This incorrect Mr appeared on the screen as well in the room and also when we checked out they talked to my husband using my name. We wanted to use the swimming pool in the evening and it was so cold we couldn't go in. All the pools had the same degree... Oke, then we thought let's use the sauna and steam room. We could not enjoy wellness together as both the sauna and steam room are separate for men and women. Basically that was the main reason we went to Lebua for our last night of the honeymoon, to relax and use the wellness facilities. Big disappointment I have to say. After this, we had no interest in going upstairs to the roof, especially after we read about the compulsory consumption.
Around 8 p.m a cleaning lady knocked on the door if we need anything. She was nice but very unexpected at this hour.

Second, The breakfast line is not worth for cost. there is no variety and the quality is so low. not meet 5-star standard. The seats is nbot enough in peak time. We have to waiting for queue or have to share the table with others. it express the bad management about this hotel.

Bangkok,Novotel Bangkok Sukhumvit 20 - SHA Certified,9,"I liked the cleaning service. The cleaner of room 2411 was lovely and always left my room super clean and smelling fresh with clean sheets, towels and complimentary water bottles. The swimming pool is nice although the water was always extremely cold. The view from the 9th floor is good. I got a room with the city view but the view is not breathtaking, just a bunch of buildings and constructions.. I stayed at Novotel hotel for 7 nights. When I was checking in, I waited too long for my bags and luggage to be transferred to my room by the concierge, so I told the receptionist that I‚Äôll take them myself. She didn‚Äôt even try to help and let me take all my heavy bags on my own. On the first day, I was placed in a room that smelled of sweat with sheets and towels not smelling fresh. I requested a new room which I received on the 24th floor. The new room didn‚Äôt smell as bad but wasn‚Äôt freshly cleaned and still seemed like the room has been forgotten for a while, and the slippers were already open. Could be left from the previous guests. Also there was a noise in my room every day, on my last day I woke up at 4 am because the noise wouldn‚Äôt stop. I didn‚Äôt feel welcome on the first day. It was ok after the first day when the cleaner has been in. The cleaner of the room 2411 was lovely, and left my room clean and smelling fresh every day. The Breakfast buffet is not great. On the second day chefs were daydreaming and I had to call them out to ask for an omelette. Omelettes didn‚Äôt taste great, chefs seemed inexperienced and the omelette looked like scrambled eggs on my last day. Not seasoned, didn‚Äôt have enough of the ingredients I asked for, barely any cheese in it and no salt/pepper on my table. Got my soy latte order wrong twice during my stay and instead got latte with regular milk and a glass of soy milk. Breakfast buffet staff members seem confused, not trained properly and inexperienced. Because of this, I only attended breakfast 3 times out of 7 days of my stay in Bangkok and went to Coffee club instead most days. Overall, I I shouldn‚Äôt have paid that much for the stay and shouldn‚Äôt have included breakfast during my stay. Next time I‚Äôm in Bangkok, I will stay at another hotel that I know of, which doesn‚Äôt have a big name but is twice less expensive, much newer, cleaner and welcomes their guests with a freshly cleaned room and a warm welcoming letter..",5,0.9793,9.8965,8.67342

The gym was decent but the running machines are metal and kept giving electric static shocks so probably needs be earthed and grounded to stop this.
The room bathroom isn't for people of age or bad health, you had to jump and pull yourself in to a raised bath to have a shower but still nice.

It is modern and simply classy
It has a great location as Soi 30 is a very helpful position between two major shopping malls and loads of Sukhumvit fun around
However given that the hotel was only 15% full I should have expected an automatic upgrade offer; but I had to ask and was told it wasn‚Äôt normal to upgrade a Booking .com booking! It was done but it rather made me feel a bit ‚Äòpoor‚Äô for asking.
I was really hungry but the food at the only open bar was finished Apparently it closes at 5pm!
Waited ages for a lift and after a day or two of this I realised the lifts were turned off except one.
The pool bar was closed and getting drinks and food orders from the downstairs was long and difficult.
The roof top bar was closed too...
All of this to some extent i understand but 
A Tell the client before they make the booking what to expect (these issues not on Booking .com; not sure where the fault for that lies)
B Tell the client on check in, with apologies
Then we all know what to expect without feeling let down

Called the reception and I was suggested to use the facilities like shower at the swimming pool , which was 18 floor down. Went down to the reception and demanded a change of room, only then they changed my room. Was it really worth trying to squeeze me in a room with no hot water ? The problem may not have occured if they only put me in the second room with hot water. I suppose they thought it was worth trying and see what happens.

Bangkok,Pathumwan Princess Hotel,8.9,"- Location was just amazing and perfect to visit everything. I was worried, before arriving if this part of the city could be a good starting point to sightseeing the city but once we arrived we felt like was the best choice. We even had food stalls under the MBK center that were so cute. The surroundings are just perfect because there is everything you need and it's a nice neighborhood always crowded and safe.
Skytrain and all public transport so much near. We honestly used most of the time taxis since they're so cheap and the hotel catches them for you. You can choose to get one with the taxi meter on or a fixed price. Our fare from the airport to the hotel was 350 bahts and hotel- airport was 340 plus highway tolls.
- Everyone is friendly and help you with your needs without hesitation.
- The room is very much clean and comfortable, beds are very good and they have a wide selection of pillows you can choose from. They give you free water bottles everyday.
- Room service is amazing, their food is great and have good prices.
- there is a 7 eleven two meters away which provides you everything you could ever need.
- MBK center is in the same building of the hotel and has different entrances from inside so it's very comfortable doing some shopping there and bringing into the room the heavy bags before heading out again to visit the city.
- The swimming pool is huge! Amazing and relaxing.
- The quality of sleep is very good. You can set the temperature of the room as you like.
-The room is so spacious and we'll equipped, you can open all the baggage you want.. - Guests are sometimes way too loud at night when they come back or in the morning when they go away. This means that rooms must be better isolated..",10,0.9988,9.994,8.0658

It is close to the Skytrain and you can walk directly across the pretty Queen's Park to the Emporium which offers a nice food selection, along with very high end western chains that cost more than in the US. Across from the Emporium is an even higher priced collection of new stores (Quartier ?) featuring the most expensive stores in NY and San Francisco. I see a lot of mall walkers enjoying the air conditioning and glitz but I don't see anyone actually buying anything. There are some excellent reasonably priced restaurants on the 3-4 top floors there.. I appreciated the free secured parking, but driving to the hotel can be a bit challenging during rush hour or anytime after dark and impossible without a good GPS.

The most disappointing aspects though were that the kids club is unstaffed unless you request it, and they charge you for breakfast even if included in your rate. Apparently the charge is removed at checkout, but this is needless and creates confusion, particularly when the staff cannot explain what is actually occurring.
These issues were adding up, so I decided to check out and move hotels. Therein lay another problem, as when they charges me at the end they added tax to the price of the stay, despite me showing them documentation that the price was tax inclusive.

Bangkok,Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square,8.3,"Breakfast was fantastic. They had 3 live chefs, 1 making pancakes, 1 making eggs, and the other making Thai dishes. There was also plenty of fruit, vegetables, breads of various sorts, croissants, muffins, toasters, and so forth. Three kinds of juices were available, although the orange juice was from a mix. On another cart there was breakfast cereal, yogurt, cheese, sliced meat and milk. In yet another part of the dining area was a full set of hot Thai dishes including the highly desired rice soup (a breakfast favorite in Thailand). The room was quite comfortable and spacious considering this is a hotel right in the heart of Bangkok. The location was excellent: easy access (walking distance) to all the major shopping malls and BTS. Covid-19 protective measures were in place, showing that the hotel takes the threat seriously. The measures did not in any way interfere with being able to enjoy the breakfast buffet or hotel facilities. Did not get a chance to try out the pool this time around, but it seemed well maintained and of a good size. The pool also had a shallow section for children. There was free parking on the premises: two floors underground, below the hotel. But ... see below.. Although the parking was free, on every single day we drove out, we experienced a *tremendous hassle* from the management of Siam Square Parking. Apparently there is little to no communication between the hotel and the external parking management. The first night the outside parking guard didn't allow my wife to park our car in the hotel parking garage! She had to exit Siam Square, and was then into heavy Bangkok traffic, taking her a good 30 minutes to get back to the hotel. The next morning the outside parking attendant wanted to charge us 620 baht for overnight parking ... even though we showed her our hotel registration confirmation. She finally called the hotel, and they confirmed our registration, after which the charge was waved. On the second day, the same thing occurred. In fact we were sitting there for *20 minutes* with no resolution. I got so angry I jumped out of the car, ran back to the hotel, and brought the maitre'd to deal with these people. Again, everything was resolved and there was no extra charge, but it was *not* a good way to start the day. We even had the hotel print a letter with hotel letterhead, which was ignored..",8,0.9535,9.7675,7.83045

The rooftop bar staff were polite and friendly.
The location is perfect. You can access many nearby restaurants, office buildings, and shopping centers. Public busses stop nearby and the Ari BTS station is very close by.
The smart TVs with wireless casting were a great choice and paired with my laptop easily, without an HDMI cable occupying desk space.. We booked The Quarter Ari for its facilities and were immediately told upon check-in that due to the new wave of COVID 19 cases, the gym and pool were off limits (understandable). HOWEVER, that same night we saw many Thai patrons (some with their children) enter and exit the gym freely, using the machines and equipment as they wished. Why were we as foreign Bangkok residents denied access? Why not reduce the rate or provide compensation instead of charging your customers a high price for facilities they cannot use?
Our key cards were deactivated at some point for 4/5 days of our stay. Once or twice is understandable, but after a stressful week of working late due to COVID 19 issues, going up to the 23rd floor only to be denied access to your room and having to get it reset at the front desk becomes a problem. This is not fun when you're carrying heavy bags after working long hours and need to use the restroom.
The showerhead in our bathroom was not assembled correctly and would create a sideways torrent that sprayed the bathroom floor whenever using the shower, unless we held the showerhead in the corner.

At the egg station, there were eggs on the counter, but they were cold and even had a film on the top where they had been sitting there a while. Most times there was no one behind the counter to fix fresh eggs. I at breakest one day at 6:30 am and the other day at 7:30 am and the service was the same..

Bangkok,Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit,9.3,"I stayed 3 weeks in this hotel after extending multiple times. It's a new hotel and looks nice. Rooms are clean. Gym has good equipment. Most of the staff are friendly but it's hit and miss. I think the staff could do with some additional training.. They require full payment in advance upon checkin + 2000 per day deposit. So if you're staying 1 week, you're paying fully in advance and then also having a 14,000 baht hold on your credit card. I think thats a ridiculous policy, given that it can take 3 weeks for that money to release on your card. I tried to discuss it with the front office manager but I found her to be a rude arrogant woman. I explained all other 5 star hotels I've been too don't operate this way. I tried to ask for the hotel manager, she tried to claim she's the hotel manager. Not so, since I met the hotel manager a few days earlier (a foreigner).
The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night across the entire hotel. So the lobby was full of people. That's where I met the hotel manager mentioned above as he came in from home. He said it's a malfunction and I noticed they had to kill the system for a day or two as the red light wasn't flashing on the smoke detector.
They have a silly policy of not allowing grab or foodpanda riders to simply ride up to the front of the hotel to deliver food. Security force them to go around the back of the hotel through boom gates, get a parking card, and all this rubbish. Completely unnecessary and confusing for the riders and the guests.
They claim the restaurant is open 24 hours for room service. In actual fact the restaurant closes at 9pm and if you order food after 9pm you can only choose from the ""night menu"" which has about 5 things on it. No Thai food whatsoever.

The scrambled eggs came out cold though. The Cesar salad dressing was way too sour. You may be asking well I did finish the food, yes because I was hungry.

To make sure it wasn't just us, we listened to the ducted air conditioner in the Twin Room that our teenage boys were staying in opposite us and that was so quiet. We have stayed at Ibis hotels around Thailand and never encountered this in any of the Family Rooms we book, to add, the air conditioning in the breakfast area was so cold that the windows were misting up, so we chose to in the garden area and the rain held up.

i have booked a 5 star hotel with much lower price ( Sheraton hotel) and i thought maybe i could get a better hotel.
but when i went there i surprised about every thing...
sooner check in (at 10 a.m)
room service ( cleaning 2 times daily)
staff (they concern about you even more than yourself!!)
any request that you have from staff they will do it for you in 5 minute
breakfast (you will experience new items daily)
you will get there all things that you excepted from a five star hotel.
swimming pool ( you can experience an area as like as a quiet island in heart of the Bangkok)

All remaining staff can be complemented on their appearance, politeness and care for the guests.. You will note from Q2 that I was disappointed with ""Facilities"" and ""breakfast"" for the following reasons.
1. The television did not have any decent news (BBC) or other programmes in English and also the reception on the television was very poor.
2. Although I can fully understand that with the present world wide situation ie the extreme shortage of clients due to the Covid crisis. I can also understand that too lay on a buffet breakfast for such limited guests would not only be wasteful financially but also with the food items that would need to be thrown away on a daily basis, but, I did find the choice offered was extremely poor and did not meet expectations.

Great location, walking distance to terminal 21, and lots of places to go to. The pool is beautiful but unfortunately then sauna was closed that time due to Thai government Covid19 policy. Overall, the service was really good and comfortable with an excellent coffee maker at the Lobby. The receptionists are very assistive and speaks great English. Will definitely stay here again and highly recommended to my family and friends, a touch of classic stay in the heart of Bangkok City.. The only downside about the hotel was it is old fashioned and will be left out from other newly built and bigger hotels in Bangkok. Old type facilities and the house keeping was not smiling enough and looked so bored while giving us the extra hotel amenities I requested to be brought to our room. The signal and channels from the TV in the room is out of service and the technician just gave us Thai local channels. Wifi was a bit slow at the 11th floor.

Nice espresso machine in the lobby. A very small convenience store on property . Swimming pool OK, but smallish. Gym is good.. A bit of a challenge to get the original type of room that was requested and assured to get, even though due to Covid, there were not many guests. My guess was that many floors were closed off to reduce maintenance.
Restaurant on property serves a mediocre breakfast, which again maybe due to Covid (that excuse works for just about any shortcoming!). Not buffet style: you can order one thing from a set menu, and have that same thing again, if you want.

We arrived as the COVID-19 outbreak was just staring to get serious in Thailand and instead of looking to help their guests with an eye to the future, they were interested only in gouging now. I needed to travel south to complete some work and they refused to let me check out for a couple of days and come back. They wanted all the money and they wanted it now. The hotel at any time during my stay here was never more than ¬º full so they could hardly argue we were stopping other guests from checking in. The situation only got worse on our last day. We are on one of the few remaining flights out of Bangkok before they head into some of the same restrictions that the rest of the world is encountering. Our flight is at midnight and when I asked if we could have a late checkout, they said no we would have to pay for an extra half day. So much for the community pulling together. Seriously I think there is about 6 rooms that are currently occupied, and instead of generating some good will for a customer they just wanted to gouge out any last minute funds they could. I paid the money but will never set foot inside the place again.

I pulled up in a Toyota Fortuner with the audacity to be black and checking into such a place and the doorman, in Thai, asked the driver if I was checking in. I let him know that I was. He then passed my door without opening it as he had intended to do in the first place but then noticed that I am black and decided to skip it. Don't worry, I called him back to open the door. They also sent the cleaner to my room while I was getting ready to leave to ask me if I was checking out. I didn't understand why. When I said something to the front desk girl about it she raised her voice at me, pretty much the ultimate in rudeness in Thai culture. I would say customer service is hit or miss.

The breakfast option was great, many type of cuisines to choose from although, the waiting time for food to arrive would take awhile. 
The in room dining options was great as well, with food that tasted great. We had the opportunity to dine at the balcony which was facing the beach. 
We had asked for late check out in view of the many hours wasted during our arrival and the hotel was kind enough to grant our request. That made up for the poor experience during check in and we were able to spend our time at the beach the next day and not hurrying for check out. 
Overall experience, was 7/10.. Check in process took 1.5 hours to queue until being attended to. After which, we were told the room was not ready and it will take 30 minutes. We were promised that room availability will be expedited but we ended up having to wait for an hour for the room to be finally ready. 
The check in counters were poorly managed. The counter staff had to go in and out from their offices to photocopy and get the keys ready. However, I noticed there's an abundance of space just behind the counter for these things to be made available so the services can be provided efficiently and effectively. 
We noticed that the counter staff were made victims of the poor management (long waiting time for check in and room not available for most guests) as guests started to become frustrated and they had to attend to the complaints as well as to facilitate check ins. They had to overpromise to cushion the blow of rooms not being ready yet but of cos it was under delivered. We witnessed alot of unhappiness from so many other guests who were experiencing the same issue like we had and for a moment it made us feel like we had overpaid the hotel for such poor service. 
May the management look at this process and make improvements to smoothen the check in process.
We arrived at 3.15 pm and only got out room at 6.15 pm. Half the day gone battled with heavy rain and we could not go elsewhere to wait except for the lobby and to get a free welcome drink at the cafe downstairs..",7,0.97,9.85,8.26856

Despite me not pre-booking my spa session, the lovely staff made it work for me, and I had a splendid (albeit expensive) massage. We also paid extra for early check-in and late check-out so could extend our stay. If we could, we would have spent more time here, relaxing and reading the days away.... What could have been better...earlier/extended hours for pool side F&B is clearly needed. Lunch opened only at 12 so you can imagine how folks with kids rushed to get their orders in.

The infrastructure, decor although nice, within the hotel, is indeed getting old and can really use some retouch/upgrade.

The food at the restaurants were great! It was also really good that we could order everything through the online app instead of having to wait for a staff member to be available. Inversely, because of this, when you need someone to ask questions, they're always available.
Spa was also SUPERB! The staff were professional and the ambience was top notch!. In-room dining could be better. Fries tasted refried. However, the food wasn't bad at all. it was just not as good as I would expect with those prices.

2)there wasnt any comb and we had to request for it. 
3) I feel there should be a more transparent way of booking the facilities as people may have taken advantage of it. Called the reception and was told it was fully booked but when I went to take a look, there was not a single person using it. I feel it is good to have staff at swimming pool area to clear out unused towels else they could help allocate space for people. Also went to the pool at around 7pm and there were a lot of crows flying by to take a sip of water from the pool.
4) room was not really very sound proof as we could hear the bass of speakers from other rooms. 
5) Most disappointing was the ala carte buffet breakfast. I feel that the quantity could be in smaller portion so guests are able to really enjoy the buffet spread. Ordered laksa with a huge portion but comes with only a single prawn for the price of the buffet, it seemed a little ridiculous.

Underpass connector - very convenient to access carpark (a few steps required) and French restaurant.. Room - we didn't appreciate the steps in the room which we had to go up and down numerous times. My friend slipped and nearly fell down the steps. They caused inconvenience with no benefit. 
Window in room - the frames were perfect to view the exceptional view outside, but both window panes were dirty and obstructed the view. It was a real let-down, considering the perfect facing of our room.

Musky smell in room - when we entered the room the first time, there was a stench of musky smell. It lasted till night, even after a kind staff came to spray some air refresher..",8,0.9653,9.8265,8.41815

Singapore,"The Fullerton Hotel Singapore (SG Clean, Staycation Approved)",9.1,"The bed was comfy and the bathroom was amazing. The space was good for a couple and a baby. Baby had a good night's sleep and we were also well rested.. The service was bad. 
Had to wait almost an hour for the baby cot and bathtub which I already requested in the booking beforehand and it was confirmed by their staff via booking.com chat. The plate and knife i requested also took super long to come as well.
Check-out was the worst experience. The manager had to tell the counter staff to open more counters when I was in the queue to check out at 12pm (normal check -out time) and the staff hurriedly went behind the counters and wore their blazers. Then the manager proceeded to ask me if I was checking out. After I answered ""yes"", he took the key cards and dropped them into the express check-out box and went to the counters to instruct his staff. I did not even finish talking. He did not even ask if there was anything else I need or just say ""thank you for staying with us"". My husband had to go over to him to tell him that we were not done talking. Then the manager apologised and asked what else did we need. I really did not expect this level of service from a reputable hotel chain. 
I also don't understand why the doormen had to ask if we needed help when they saw that we were lugging a lot of stuff with a baby. They should be asking if they could help because it is already obvious that we needed help?.",4,0.959,9.795,8.41815

Thank you to Eric, Jimmy, Charles, Mr Amin, Ms Yiling.. However, Pan Pacific Hotel overall service was just basic in accommodating the guests needs but not exceeding the guests expectations. I had gave my suggestions to them separately and it would be wonderful if Pan Pacific hotel could create and enhance their customers experience instead. Also, excellent service is now expected every where, so it is about time that hotels should level up their games (in competitions). 
- check-in at 3pm and there was long queues at both registration counters 
- Customer Service Eric was there to help ushering the guests to the next available counter. He should ask the guest in the queue instead if they need help in any ways. This is because I was in the queue alone while the rest of my family members were seating at the couch. After 10-15mins, I had to approach Eric for a priority queue cos I have an elderly pax and require a wheelchair (70 years old). He acknowledged and usher me to the next available counter. Thank you Eric.

So once we‚Äôre done with the check-in we were told that the female staff (If I can remember correctly her name was Kiki(?)) will escort us to our room! Which is very sweet and nice of them to do this.. As we were on our way to our room, we had a chat and she was very persistent on what kind of room we booked. The moment we reach our doorstep she told us to brace ourselves....
BAM! The hotel actually gave us a surprise upgrade from a Deluxe Double Room to a Suite King Smoking Room (which is so great because both of us are smokers) üòÅ This was truly the most memorable thing that ever happened to us! We were so shocked and we couldn‚Äôt stop thanking them.

Ridiculous procedure on going to the pool, have to bring whole fam to front office to check temperature and get another key card to entre the pool area. Don't know why cannot just 1 of the staff to sit outside the pool area like most hotels do to do the temperature taking etc. Reason being is shortage of manpower. (Not guest problem if really does and plus its a weekend stay.. )
No extra garbage bag provided inside the room, shud provide one as you know its a apartment kind right, so where fo throw all our rubbish if we stayed there for more than a night.. Cant be calling everytime the rubbish is full. 
Also have to go down and bring all the rubbish and asked where to throw. Staff didnt bother to offer help but instead show us direction of the place to throw. üòÖ

Singapore,W Singapore - Sentosa Cove (SG Clean),8.6,"Sentosa- Location and this is the only reason I booked this Hotel.
Scenery , sunset view in the evening and moon view at night. Very good. but I have to pay additional money to get the scenery...
Free Island Bus.
Many good restaurants nearby - little expensive but worth the money though! ( Mexican and Italian Food Restaurant was the best ). Balcony with wet cushion chair which made our Pants totally wet, We thought its dry but it is not.
Bed were too small for 1 Adult and 1 Child, although it was mentioned it will fit for 2 adults easily. It was not.
Breakfast - probably one of the worst breakfast I have ever had compare to any Hotel that I have stayed before around the world. Very limited vegetarian menu. I canceled my second day breakfast offered price, then the first day breakfast became expensive. Not worth the money at ALL. I had to eat nearby restaurants which was much cheaper.
Toilet was not good too. Its an average style.
TV channel - The Remote was not working properly. No BT connection for the TV in the room, and enough or right cable to connect iphone to their TV, to stream movies from Online Services. I had purchased their movies which cost me some SGD16/movie. Although I have a Netflix , Disney and Apple TV subscription.

However there was a single chair in the room. So staying in the room was not possible unless you are in bed. The room had no table for dining in, they at least were very helpful in bringing some chairs from their conference room for dinning in. 
Also the furniture in the balcony is fancy but not comfortable. So we did not realy have a nice place to lounge close to the plunge pool. The furniture mattress also does not dry properly so it has a strange unpleasant smell. They should replace it by the very comfortable lounge chair they have around the pool. Also I would suggest that they take out the useless empty plant pot outside and place instead a table and 2 chairs close to the pool like they have in the other rooms.

Singapore,Citadines Balestier (SG Clean),8.9,Generally very good! Very well designed and laid out so the effect was both visually pleasing and spacious. Superbly clean. Quiet. Ventilation: could be improved? The room smelled a little dank on entry. And odours from another room‚Äôs cooking infiltrated into the room I was in.,8,0.9365,9.6825,8.266875
Singapore,Citadines Balestier (SG Clean),8.9,"Excellent location: easy access to public transport, a stone‚Äôs throw away from Orchard Road, and with direct bus and underground connections to other parts of town
Property: tastefully designed and laid out, so that each area and room feels spacious and comfortable, and is visually pleasing. Property was superbly clean both outside, as well as inside, the building, in the common areas (including lift lobby of the floor) as well as in the room. I noticed that the housekeeping staff removed their shoes when they enter the room to clean and I really appreciated that thoughtfulness and the level of hygiene
Amenities in the room: kitchenette, washer/dryer were especially appreciated - made my long stay not only pleasantly convenient but also comfortably clean
Staff: the housekeeping staff - cleaning of the rooms were effectively, efficiently, and quietly done (i.e. no loud screaming in the hallways and corridor) and I appreciate the luxury and the sanctuary this stillness provided. Ventilation: could be improved? I could smell the fumes from cooking in other rooms in my room
The service I feel, though good and friendly, lacked true hospitality and warmth. I had to extend my stay from 3 to 4 weeks. I was told by reception that occupancy was very high, it was not possible to extend beyond 3 days, and a higher rack-rate would be charged per night. And that as there were also no other room types available I should look for solutions elsewhere
I subsequently found another (smaller) room in the same property on Booking.com. I was told by reception that as occupancy was high, that staff that I must check-out of the existing room at noon, and check-in for the new room again after 15:00. In between they could store my luggage
I understand and did not expect bend-over-backwards efforts to accommodate my extension. I fully understand I must vacate my room by noon to allow it to be cleaned and turned around for the next guest. I appreciate that I can only check in to my new room not before 15:00 as the room needs to be turned around after the last guest.
What is did not appreciate are the following:
(1) to be reminded 4 hours before I am due to vacate the room that I have to do so, and that my newly assigned room will not be available before 15:00, and that I should start to pack. Bearing in mind there has to be obviously a little tiny bit of buffer between me and the next guest because theoretically I could have extended my stay by 3 days
(2) the cold language (or what I perceive as cold)
These ‚Äòservices‚Äô and experience made me feel like the most unwanted guest, that I am not welcomed at the Citadines Balestier.
My needs and demands were minimal during my stay. Beyond check-in, asking if there was a possibility to extend my stay, and check-out, I had not had to trouble the reception staff. My room was always kept tidy as a manner of respect to the housekeeping staff. I had no opportunity to use the other hotel facilities..",9,0.9966,9.983,8.266875

First,we didnt like the frequency of the lift as I have to wait for more than 10 minutes just to get to the lobby from 1st floor and only one lift was moving from different floors and the other two lifts were just idle. Second, there wasnt any kitchen towel provided to wipe off the kitchen area as well as the crockeries and cutleries. Third, the absence of any trash bin for us to discard the rubbish from our room.

The bed was super comfortable and we had the best naps of our lives.

Compliments to Idayu at the Hotel Reception to help us out with our baggage (which included a special important cake) and being so helpful with both directions and our accommodation as well. Thank you so much for making this trip an especially exceptional one.. There are only two shortfalls when it comes to our stay. Firstly, the shuttle bus timing intervals are pretty sparse apart and we had to keep to their timing pretty carefully just in case we didn't wanna waste anytime anywhere and didn't want take too much time getting to the location of the resort which is pretty isolated from the rest of the main island. 
The other feedback we wanna give is the knob to our shower which changes between the rainfall and the shower head.

- Staff were good. For SG1250/pn for a family suite (2a/2k) there is a certain level of expectation. Most of which was not met. 
- The Room. It was basically a master bedroom (no ensuite) and an adjoining living area with a sofa bed, desk and bathroom. This adjoining living area had no natural light.

The best thing you can experience in this hotel is that every small detail contains thoughtful arrangements and dosing, and it makes you feel really comfortable.

3. The bed! So comfortable! Love it!
4. Love the design and style of the hotel.
5. The pool time was enjoyable! They have nice view, nice facilities and nice service! 
6. Convenient location! Walking distance to all famous sights and delicious restaurants. The neighborhood was stylish, esp the ruffle street and colonial style buildings.
7. They have cute guide card in the room to show you where to go.
8. The whole stay was enjoyable and relax. We have been to Mandarin Oriental hotel in HK and Beijing, and we had great time there too. And I think I would choose Mandarin Oriental again!. 1. Maybe the main cafe for breakfast was too loud, busy and crowded, which makes you hard to enjoy your meal especially when you are expecting a cozy and relaxing breakfast during vocation.
2. Also the night bedding service could have been better. One night when we got back to our room, the beds were still a mess. We thought they forgot to clean our room. But then I saw an extra pillow in the end of my bed, looked like someone put it there casually and left. That is the pillow we asked for during daytime. So they came to our room without making night bed and left....everything lacked was not fulfilled, which was not that important. However, it felt really not good looking at your bed the way you left it - a bit messy.
3. As a member of Mandarin Oriental, the hotel offers you a free drink ticket ai M bar to their member. But they forgot to give me mine. When I asked during check out, they apologized and offered me one. I had to leave for airport and had no time using it. Kind of a pity since I do love their special made cocktails,haha~

The vicinity have it's charm with a wide array of shops selling cloths, linens, rugs and lamps of middle eastern looks.. It's my second stay here and the room condition is a bit old and I hope the hotel will refurbish it especially replacing the old wooden table top. Even my friend did jokes, "" it remind him on one of his Batam hotel stay üòπ""
I felt a bit uncomfortable with the bath tub stopper cos it's a bit weary .Though it does the trick, there's always concern that it will just pop out and the water will drain out ..",7,0.9931,9.9655,7.31972

Water pressure - It was awesome and wish I can have this at my home. 
Staff - All that I met were courteous and helpful.
Hangers - Lots of hangers in the wardrobe, something that is not usually found usually.
Room - The room size is bigger than most I've encountered when on staycation. The bed is huge, can easily fit 2 adults and 2 kids. The bed and pillows are super comfortable. The room is clean indeed although it shows it's age but quite well-maintained. 
Location - Awesome. I love Bugis area and this hotel is exactly where it needed to be.. No bidet spray - Please consider to install bidet spray in all the rooms. As this hotel is popular with muslim families & this is an important feature.
Swimming pool - May need to review the booking system for the swimming pool. While I was informed that I have to call to book pool in advance, it may be better that guests are informed to book a.s.a.p. as slots get full very fast or, the reception can help to make the booking upon check-in. This would be especially helpful for guests like me who only stayed for 1 night. We have very limited hours to get to enjoy the pool. However, booking in advance may not be the best when you have very limited slots and/or during peak period, like now during school holidays. May need to open the pool 1 hour earlier also instead of 9am during such periods. Guests might just book but don't turn up. I noticed few people at the pool last evening & this morning. May have to consider on a 1st come 1st serve basis & allow each admitted guest 1 hour to enjoy the pool. I tried getting a morning slot the afternoon before but to no avail. Sure, the swimming pool is not that big & no kiddie pool either, but this is an important feature for kids when they staycation - to be able to enjoy the pool as much as they can.
Breakfast - No buffet breakfast. I understand that this is due to safety measurements. However, we (there were only the 2 of us, me and my youngest) had to leave our table for a while as my youngest had to visit the restroom & we informed the staff at the entrance of the restaurant about it. We expected to be able to come back & finish the breakfast we paid for. Unfortunately, this was not the case. While we were able to re-enter the restaurant, we found that our table had been cleared.

Lovely 5 course dinner arrangement by Thirty8, Chelsea.
Valuable dining discounts as Standard Chartered Credit Card user, a surprise offer by restaurant attendant, Suleiman.
Great customer service during checkin by concierge, Nazrul.
Unique ambiance with KLCC Tower view at both hotel room and restaurant.
Spacious room with full glass window.
Premium toiletries.
Splendid room deco, romantic setup with rose petals and pretty bouquet of flowers.
Good communication system design, each room compartments has its own phone connected to the hotel services and 1 for beside bed is wireless with colored LCD.
Had an emergency midnight checkout with concierge Chairyl and trusted him to give away my upgraded breakfast coupon to those in need necessarily. Hope he‚Äôs an earnest attendant.
Ultimately, it worths everything! We both loved it. Thanks a lot Grand Hyatt KL!. Thirty8 5 course menu looks interesting but does not taste as good as it appears.
Too much attention on garnish and cosmetics, less on taste.
Plenty stains (visible on phone camera) on room window spoiling the beautiful night view of KL.
Pillows are soggy, not comfortable for the neck and back, bed and and quilt were perfect though.
No extra pillows.
Nice bathroom but normal size bath tub, kills the moment of a couple bath.
Tub‚Äôs shower head was leaking, sprays and splashes water all over, second kill.
Elevator from G to SL was too slow, had to queue at G for lift, and further need to change to another lift.
There‚Äôs a Kiblah but no prayer mat. Should have been offered in a menu. No Holy Book found too.
Bathroom glass door sliding mechanism is hazardous, harsh close could break it.
Light switches are not 100% integrated, some lamps‚Äô switches are localized.
After all, of course there are always room for improvement.

Kuala Lumpur,Traders Hotel Kuala Lumpur,8.8,"The room however, still fantastic. Comfy bed. Good bathroom. Just enough for a one night stay. The crowd is huge though. If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet stay, probably weekdays are better choice.. Check in process
Stayed here for a quick weekend getaway (March 27, 2021). This was my 3rd time staying in Traders Hotel, after a few years gap. I‚Äôve always loved this hotel mainly due to its location and the comfortable stay. 
I stayed here during the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and just like any other hotels around the world, strict SOPs are implemented and must be adhered to - which is of course, why not. 
However, I am not sure why, the check-in process was terribly SLOW. I was only queuing behind 4 guests, but oh dear, it took about good 45-50 mins before it was my turn! Only 5 staffs were attending the check-in process. Apparently, guests MUST provide a copy of IC / passport for EACH and everyone staying in the rooms booked. Well, I do understand this is the rule anywhere, especially when you‚Äôre a foreigner. But as a Malaysian, honestly, I HARDLY provide the details of my roomates, family members, etc. simply because it wasn‚Äôt requested. Even if I booked a room (or 2-3 rooms) based on the ACTUAL pax staying, usually I was just asked to provide my IC and that‚Äôs it. 
But if it‚Äôs the rule, okay I get it but I would highly suggest that Traders highlight this requirement upfront in their booking partners, or emails, or anything - because you know, people won‚Äôt be queuing together with their 50 family members in one line for check-in obviously because it‚Äôs a bit inconvenient and we‚Äôre following the SOP and it‚Äôs a mess, inconvenient and embarrassing to run around screaming asking for their ICs. There was this one guy, walking around asking for ICs in a loud volume, creating unnecessary panic and discomfort as if we are a thief checking in illegally into the hotel..",8,-0.1835,4.0825,7.910295

Kuala Lumpur,"The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection",8.9,"Not applicable.. The experience is extremely terrible for an reowned autograph hotel like The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur which used to be a very high end hotel.
Firstly, it was delay in check in for 3 hours. We checked in at 5pm but the room which supposed to be ready at 3pm is not ready yet. The hotel front desk just said it is due to voluminous turnover. The refreshment served for the guests waiting for check in is horrible. 
Second, the breakfast buffet served at Contago is totally not in line with the food that this kind of hotel shall offer, the food like nasi lemak is not heated up properly, congee is tasteless. 
Lastly, there is no security at all. The cleaner came into our room without permissiona before us checking out, and offered towels which we did request for. Things are worst when this happened when the guest is using restroom. This is criminal offence and front desk just trying to resolve this by saying refund us the fee we paid for a night.

Kuala Lumpur,"The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection",8.9,"We were lucky to get the corner room
so we had a panoramic view of the surrounding area. I did inquire the hotel on availability of services for special occasions (since it was to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday) to which they said it was an extra RM100 for decorations (among others of which I can‚Äôt remember). I did not proceed with it but they were kind enough to take note and delivered a slice of cake with a chocolate icing on the plate saying ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù. Nice touch!
We chose the room rate with breakfast included which I think was a wise choice as despite not in the pre-pandemic style buffet, the hotel did not deprive us with selections of food and managed to execute the drop-your-stick-to-order-and-we‚Äôll-send-it-to-your-table approach flawlessly. Needless to say I was still full past lunch time! Think the staffs were like ninjas, sometimes the food got to our table before we did!. There were 4 long queues to check in when we arrived just before 4pm - which I guess was understandable considering the official check in time is 3pm. Once we‚Äôve paid and checked in, we were told that our room was not yet ready so we had to wait until being called. I would have appreciated had this been told before paying. It did feel like we were ‚Äútricked‚Äù. 
The hotel prepared a waiting area just outside their ballroom for guests with my circumstance. They were kind enough to compensate with a drink station and some food - not for the famished though. If you‚Äôve got kids, it‚Äôs an ample running area for them. 
All in all, it took 2 hours from the moment we joined the check in queue to the point of getting a call informing our room was ready. I wasn‚Äôt entirely happy but it was understandable given it being a weekend and people are staying local for a vacation. 
I appreciate & applaud the staffs behind the reception who managed to keep their composure, moving superbly fast (each guest took exactly 8 minutes to be checked in) and perseverance to endure some of the more emotional customers. So kudos to them!
However a delayed checkin time not caused by the customer should be fairly compensated by more than a mere drink and mini food station. I hope the hotel could give more thoughts into this..",8,0.9961,9.9805,7.43122

Bento Style serving not presentable, (although staff explain is an MCO's menu) with unmatch cutlery spoiled the experience for a 5 Star hotel. imagine using oversize fork and spoon to scoop food from japanese style bento box, i,e, chicken w/bones and braised lamb with big bones. (messy ~~). Dessert Tiramisu/Cheesecake taste so so like it has been long kept in fridge. (Only 2-3 tables of guests in including us from 730pm - 9pm)..",5,0.8686,9.343,7.43122
Kuala Lumpur,"The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection",8.9,"The suite was spacious and lovely. 
Every staff I met was friendly and helpful. 
The Majestic Wing of the hotel was beautiful with its colonial charm.
The complimentary massage at the Spa was great.. Check-in:
The check-in process was not pleasant at all. It took quite long even though there were 3 separate queues. It would be good if you had a first come first serve basis - I happened to have stood behind a couple of people who took very long with their issues (they weren't even checking in). Other people who were further back in the other lines were checked in first because their queue moved quickly. 
I understand that there was an unusually bigger crowd on NY's eve but because there were no separate concierge, every question or query had to be directed at the reception. Nearly every person I saw in front of me had a question about the parking and there were people retrieving food packages from the reception. There was also nobody who asked if I needed any help at all with my luggage. 
Getting about:
I'd also recommend better signages since I could barely find my way to the Spa from within the hotel (because it was raining that afternoon) and I had to ask for directions twice. 
Room service:
Tried to call housekeeping to ask for slippers and hand towels because it wasn't provided in the room. Had to call 2 times before someone finally picked up..",6,0.9716,9.858,7.43122

So I want to proceed with the payment first but I was shocked that I need to deposit RM500. I didn't have enough cash so I want to pay with my debit card. Unfortunately, the staff told me that the balance of the deposit (after room charges) will be refunded after 14 working days if paid through credit/debit card. Since I can't wait that long to receive my refund I have to walk away to the Pavilion searching ATM machine to cash out my money.

Coffee machine in the room
High floor. I recently booked a night in your KL hotel for my wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion we decided to upgrade our room to an executive club room in order to access the executive lounge for, 'daily breakfast, Afternoon tea and refreshments, as well as premium wine, cocktails, late check out at 4pm'.
Unfortunately, when we arrived for check in, we were informed that due to the current CMCO regulations, the lounge was closed along with the other bars in the hotel in order to keep within the social distancing guidelines from the government. We fully understood this need for safety during this time and were pleased to be allowed to use the hotel lobby area for our club needs.
However, when we tried to use this area we had to wait up to 30 minutes each time for a drink and the afternoon tea consisted of an egg sandwich, 1 curry puff and a small cake, which we thought was not quite to the hotel's specification. We tried again during the evening, to indulge in one of the hotel's cocktails which again took 30 minutes to arrive and did not contain any alcohol as the bars were closed!
The next morning, we ventured to breakfast to be met by a seen I can only describe as terrifyingly unsafe. With a global pandemic and case numbers on the increase in the city, seeing over 500 people crammed in to one restaurant was definitely not safe. We tried to gain access but we were squashed and unable to move around to obtain any food. There were no glasses, cutlery or napkins available, tables were dirty as there were limited staff to clean and replenish supplies. Nobody was wearing masks and the whole safe distancing policy was non existing - we left to return to our room hungry.

The staff at the pool was really not as I expected. we were at the pool and he said that we have to wait for the next slot which was at 11 a.m. so we said ok. And then he went on about the shorts that my husband was wearing. for your information my husband was wearing a three-quarter shorts that he wears every single time we go swimming in a hotel. but the staff said that his three quarter shorts is not allowed. my husband said tried to explain that he is a religious Muslim so he has to wear shorts That is below the knee. The answer that the staff gave was very appalling. He said so you don't have to swim you can just sit on the side. Without any apology. That is not acceptable. We are in a Muslim country and you prohibit people to wear Muslim attire to swim. is there a policy written in black and white that says a three-quarter shorts is not allowed? If there is I would really want to see it. In fact I demand to see it. I have been to other hotels and this is not the first time we stay at a five-star hotel, but this is the first time that my husband was not allowed to swim because of his three-quarter shorts. Being in a Muslim country you should be aware of clothing that Muslims are allowed to when they go swimming. By denying us the swimming pool, that is just unfair. My opinion is, your hotel should be more aware of your surroundings and your location. you have probably never received this kind of complaints before I would understand, maybe you should start thinking about it because this is just ridiculous. you have to check your policy on your swimming dress code and please let me know if the three-quarter shorts is written on the policy saying that it is not allowed.

Since we went on weekday the breakfast was served at lobby lounge instead of Lemon Garden hence not many food choices.
Very slippery bathroom when wet so need to take extra care for kids

I got to check out even later (5pm)!!!

Kuala Lumpur,THE FACE Suites,8.6,"The pool and the room is very clean and it has a working room for people to work there. I can say that other than the kitchenware, everything is fine. They have iron, iron board, washing machine, two basin in the bathroom and etc. Check in was fast, not bad.. 1) The kitchenware is insufficient. Only a work and a pot. No bowl at all. How am I gonna drink the soup? You know what, they doesn't have any a piece of cloth for me to wipe the kitchen and table. I thought that the kitchenware will be sufficient as my expectation. So next time I think I will need to bring my own pot if we need to do a family hotpot. I can't even cook rice.
Next, the bathroom floor when it is wet, it is very very slippery. Yeah, I fell down because of that, so when you walk into the bath room. 1000% caution, wet floor, very slippery.
As for the breakfast, it is OK, NICE, but I waited for tooo long. I think I go to the deep blue at 9:50 something, I guess my food come at 1030-1045. My coffee is cold. Hope that they take note on this.
Fourth, they didn't let us know that the pool is open, it should be closed due to CMCO. I missed that and we didn't bring our swimming wear. Oh well, I just treat it as it still closed, but it is a regret.
Lastly, do you know the nightmare of the lift? It is horrible. I use the word horrible is because I can wait for a lift for 45 minutes. I just need to take my grocery and because I'm alone and it is heavy. THE FREAKING LIFT AT B1 will not show the lift is at which floor. So that we only can stand and wait at the middle and guess which one reaches first. This is not the worst. The lift doesn't have line up, who is closer to the lift they get to enter priority. AND it only can fit in 4 people? WHY BOTHER? SWIMMING POOL is open and so crowded like the guest has never swim before but the lift only can fit in 4 people? When the lift reaches, I need to pick up my grocery from the floor and it is has a lot for it takes my time to pick it up, plus it didn't show the floor number so I couldn't get ready when to pick up my things. SO the freaking door closed when I picked up. I quickly go and press the UP button but the lift no bother at all. It closed. and I have to wait for few turns..",5,-0.9181,0.4095,7.170485

This is not first time i stay in Dorsett Hartamas
First of all, i had requested extra 2 towel during i check at the counter, but i never received any extra towel until i checked out
Second, the room is nice but the curtains couldn't cover the window nicely no matter how i do, something wrong with the hook which non of us can adjust it because it's more than 10 ft height, when it's sun rise the lights comea into our room we totally cannot sleep!! and also the air conditioning is nice during day time, when its mid night the air conditioning its seems like not functioning, we both husband and wife totally cannot sleep we are sweating at the night!! End up we just sleep without comforter
Regarding the bed, im not sure how hotel did the maintenance, i had some insects bite on my leg, at first its just itchy but now the same spot became swollen and red, i really cannot accept this i couldn't wear any shoes because of my leg its not comfortable at the spot that insects bite
I really disappointed on the hotel, its really out of standard

Kuala Lumpur,Dorsett Hartamas Kuala Lumpur,7.9,"A bathtub in room. Their Cleaning staffs smile and great the guests on behalf of the entire hotel.. They need more understanding how all bookings are made and work. 
A receptionist kept telling me that I'd made double bkgs via Booking.com and other bkg website ""A"".
I explained her that my first bkg with ""A"" had been automatically cancelled and I didn't get anything charged for it so the one with Booking.com was valid only for checking in.
It's common idea that your guests don't pay to the hotel directly when it's pre-paid booking thru a third party bkg channel.
My status of bkg was perfectly correct. I didn't have any issues but the hotel got confused only so asked ME to deal with the bkg channel instead of THEMSELVES.. 
I was unhappy with that situation. She finally told me ""so Miss you don't want to call?!"" and I replied ""I don't need to call. If anything wrong with this booking, you can call ""A"" to clarify. ""
It was very simple to solve. Please do not make a problem when it's not a problem at all. If you feel it's unclear, you are the one to make it clear not anyone else. 
By the way, the bkg channel ""A"" confirmed me again that my bkg had been even unable to confirm. No payment at all. The status of cancellation was correctly shown in my email and their system""

The parking - if you don't call them and ask where to park, you will be going around that place in circles one mil times. They should have some information on that posted on the web/email.
2. The elevator - we have a baby and kids. I had to walk down with the baby using the staircase cause i was worried we will be checking out late (rooms were in 8th floor) and left my husband and another child to go down with the lift.Only 45 min after, he was able to get to the lobby. With a sweaty baby getting cranky cause she was sleepy and her stroller was still stuck with her dad cause of the elevator. 27 floors building with only 2 lifts??? That is out of this world horrible. And not to mention that there was NO social distance due to the slowness of the lifts. Nobody cared anymore and it was shoulder-to-shoulder kinda situation.
3. Cleanliness - Towel smells and we asked for a change. Could be due to mco and dampy non window room. The other room that we booked had food crumble, hair in the shower, on the carpet, in the bathroom when we checked in. The bedsheet has brown stain on it..",5,-0.4367,2.8165,5.885365

There is no proper parking for inhouse guest, and parking need to paid RM10 per entry.Each time you go out you wont get the parking slot anymore.

During checkin, they told me Astro and wifi not working..I have to raise my voice for refund then they give me room with only wifi working, TV never turn out working till I check out.The moment I enter the room the light were not working and I have to call the reciption, nobody bothered to pick the call. I have to go down from 23F.That was realy testing my patience.End of the day we feel very tired and no word discribe our frust.
Breakfast did not follow SOP, they just squeze in all guest as they can.
I paid the room with breakfast buffet.But the breatfast does not turn out as expected. They never bother to refill and my kids only eat nasi lemak with sambal. No meat or chicken.The fruit counter only served water melon.No proper refill either.Drink was also the same with only laychee water with very less sugar, since ais melted, also never bother for refill.I know they are busy but they should not service like this .Can view my video and photo.

The room view in the booking website was misleading. It is not the KLCC view it is the construction view . The room in the picture come with a balcony but the actual room didnt have any, I feel like been cheated.

Kuala Lumpur,Dorsett Kuala Lumpur,7.9,"My wife and I booked a Queen room in the Dorsett Recidence. It was a nice and relaxing stay in a spacious, clean and good room on floor 28, with a small balcony facing towards the Petronas Twin Towers.. -Dorsett KL has 2 buildings, 1 is Hotel and the 2nd is Residences. For breakfast we need to walk over to the 1st building.
-Breakfast has various options, but all Asian style. For me as a European nothing to crave for. But I still got my tummy full.
-We seem to were the only foreigners in Dorsett, the breakfast room were filled with local Malaysians, they all starred at us when we came into the breakfast room. My wife told me later that Dorsett is nowadays more a hotel that locals prefer.
- swimming pool on the roof (level 30) is nice and big. My wife has worn a normal and proper swimsuit, which is allowed to wear in Malaysia. But the local family there went to the guard and complained about it. But the guard couldn‚Äôt do anything because her swimsuit is proper, so the husband took out his 2 teeny children and they all left the pool area then. My wife and I then had the whole swimming pool for us alone. 
- The view to the twin towers is blocked by another building, you can only see the top of them.
-TV: We had 3 TVs in our room, but only one was connected with a receiver box, the one in the living area. So the tv at the bed and in the bathroom (which bathtub) are useless. The receiver only has local language channels.
- the interior inside the room is not the newest anymore, but it‚Äôs still good and clean and not rundown. I rate the interior with 7 out of 10.
-our room has soo many light switches, and every switch turns on a different light. So you really need to search by clicking several switches to find which light you are looking for.
-tiny bathroom, but nice bathtub.
- the sink (wash bowl) to wash your hands or clean your face is outside the bathroom. You wash your hands and brush your teeth nearby the bed..",7,0.9032,9.516,5.994525

2. The hotel policy/SOP on the usage of the swimming pool is not clear and not well implemented.

But there was no way to call the front desk to request for anything. Yes it is a separate building from the hotel but since booking and check-in are made under Dorsett, it should offer the same services. It would've been nice to have slippers since the apartment floor was cold tiles. Astro wasn't working and TV had limited channels. The room wasn't completely clean either. The shower was moldy and the area around the bed had some leftover trash from the previous stays probably (popped balloons). The parking is also quite limited and extremely narrow.

The picture does play a great role so no worth it for me.

No reply from the phone provided seriously needs to improve on this. Very disappointing
Wifi so so only and 3/5 bar seriously and even the first day we arrive its down until night. ok lah at least still got but still slow

Without fighting we would have been probably relocated to another hotel as it appeared that the property was overbooked and understaffed. We were allowed for late check out but of course you cannot buy our lost 4 hours waiting in and out of the lobby without aircond.

The breakfast buffet overall was alright but could be better. Was disappointed with
the chicken curry as it was oily and bland. Roti canai seemed like the frozen ones. As for the pool, it seemed to have some debris not sure if it was dried leaves. Also, it would have been great if there were 2 auto pay machines as one was faulty which caused a long queue during check out.

The coffee machine with the coffee capsules is another plus point where I could always have my quick cup of expresso whenever I feel like having it. By the way, there is also a small tab ready to be used provided in the room that enable the guest to connect with the hotel staff real time, and allowing in requesting room service or any additional necessities like extra duvet, slippers etc. 
I was also impressed with the hospitality. From the moment I arrived, I was pleasantly greeted by the hotel staff and my luggage was also well taken care by the concierge. Whenever I walked passed any hotel staff, for sure they will greet you with a warm smile, and the next thing they will offer assistance by asking question like ""Is there anything that you need or I could help?"". Making you feel like a King or Queen :). The fitness center is also well equipped with both cardio and weight training equipment.

I love the tea bags provided in the room. The bath tub came with a bag of bath salt and that is very warming and the water temperature can be easily adjusted and strong pressure. The internet is strong and there is also a mood adjustment on the lightnings in the room. My package comes with breakfast and the breakfast was perfect.

It has been a great experience staying with four seasons.. If there are areas which I don't like, perhaps we start with areas which may be impossible to change,
1. The parking basement turning corners towards the lower floor are cramp.
2. It requires multiple lift rides in order to arrive at the lobby.
3. My room was upgraded from a city view to a garden views. Honestly, there wasn't that much greater if that was an upgrade.
Areas for improvements,
1. I am very sensitive towards dust and I believe the bed wasn't that clean which causes itchiness on my eye.

housekeeping cleaned the room at 330pm the next day. which was a bit late as I was hoping to return to rest at that time but had to leave the room as it was not cleaned yet...I understand there were probably other rooms that need cleaning for guests who have checked out.. though I wished the room could be cleaned earlier..
